# Privacy Preserving Data Science
Course Material for the Tutorial on Privacy Enhancing Technologies and PPML

In this tutorial we will go through a series of examples demonstrating the main features of the so-called _Privacy Preserving_ technologies. 

In the first part, we will focus on _Data Anonymisation_ and methods for privacy protection. We will see examples of  _De-Identification_, _K-Anonymity_, and a very short intro to _Differential Privacy_.

In the second part, we will be shifting the focus more on Machine (Deep) Learning, investigating in more details how _Convolutional Networks_ work on Images (using `PyTorch`), and how _susceptible_ these methods are to **Adversarial Attacks**.
The `FGSM` and the `Adversarial-Patches` attacks will be presented (with examples in PyTorch), along with some considerations on possible counter-meausures.

Finally, in the third part, we will introduce some of the main concepts for _Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning_, like _Federated Learning_ and _Homomorphic Encryption_. Two examples on medical datasets will be presented.

**Note**

All references and further suggested readings are reported in each notebook.

  

### Get the material

Clone the current repository, in order to get the course materials. To do so, once connected to your remote machine (via `SSH`), execute the following instructions:

```bash
cd $HOME  #¬†This will make sure you'll be in your HOME folder
git clone https://github.com/WebValley2021ReImagined/privacy-preserving-data-science.git
```

**Note**: This will create a new folder named `privacy-preserving-data-science`. Move into this folder by typing:

```bash
cd privacy-preserving-data-science
```

Well done! Now you should do be in the right location. Bear with me another few seconds, following instructions reported below üôè

### Updating your Environment

To execute the notebooks in this repository, a few _extra_ packages are required, but installing them in your Conda environment is super easy. 

While into the `privacy-preserving-data-science.git` folder, execute the two following instructions:

```bash
conda activate py38_default  #activate your conda environment
pip install -r requirements.txt  # to install the extra packages
```

üéâ You should be now ready to go!

The last bit is to run your `jupyter lab` server, and open the notebooks:

```bash
jupyter lab
```
